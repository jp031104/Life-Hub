# Life-Hub
Life Hub: Your All-in-One Daily Life Manager
Project Overview: "Life Hub" is a new Android mobile application developed with React Native and built with Expo, ensuring easy generation of an APK file.
Core Idea: An all-in-one mobile application designed to streamline daily life management by seamlessly integrating Task Management, Money Management, and Habit Tracking into a single, cohesive interface.
Key Features:
1.	Task Management:
o	Add & Manage: Quickly add tasks with titles, descriptions, and optional notes.
o	Completion & Scheduling: Mark tasks as completed, assign due dates and times, and set reminders for upcoming deadlines.
o	Organization (Optional Enhancements): Prioritize tasks (High, Medium, Low), organize them into lists or projects, and create recurring tasks.
2.	Money Management:
o	Income & Expense Tracking: Log incoming money (salary, gifts, etc.) and outgoing expenses with dates, amounts, and descriptions.
o	Categorization: Assign transactions to predefined or custom categories (e.g., Food, Transport, Bills).
o	Balance Overview: Display a clear overview of the current balance (Total Income - Total Expenses).
o	Financial Tools (Optional Enhancements): Implement budgeting features (set limits per category), generate financial reports/charts (spending by category over time), and support multiple accounts.
3.	Habit Tracking:
o	Define & Track: Define habits (e.g., Exercise, Read, Meditate) and easily mark them as completed for the current day.
o	Streak Tracking: Automatically calculate and display consecutive days a habit has been maintained, providing motivation.
o	Advanced Scheduling (Optional Enhancements): Set flexible schedules (e.g., specific days of the week, x times per week), add habit-specific notes, and visualize progress with calendars or charts.
4.	Simple Note:
o	A basic notepad for quick jotting down of thoughts and information.
5.	Settings:
o	Theme: Switch between light and dark themes.
o	Data Management: Option to backup all data to a zip file and import data from a backup.
User Interface (UI) & Navigation:
Life Hub prioritizes a clean, uncluttered, and intuitive user experience, following a minimalist design language with an emphasis on clarity and ease of use.
•	Navigation Tabs: A simple bottom navigation bar with four primary tabs for easy switching between sections:
o	Home Tab (Dashboard): A personalized dashboard offering a quick overview of upcoming tasks, a summary of the current balance, and today's habit status/streaks.
o	Tasks Tab: Dedicated section for all task management features.
o	Money Tab: Dedicated section for all money management features.
o	Habits Tab: Dedicated section for all habit tracking features.
•	Overall Design Language:
o	Color Palette: Primarily monochromatic (white/light gray or dark gray/black background) with one main accent color (e.g., a calm blue, green, or warm neutral) used for interactive elements, highlights, and important information. Avoid overwhelming use of multiple bright colors.
o	Typography: Clean, readable sans-serif font (like System Font, Inter, or Poppins) with clear hierarchy using font weight and size (e.g., bold titles, regular body text).
o	Layout: Generous spacing, use of cards or clear list separators to delineate items, avoiding clutter.
o	Icons: Simple, line-style icons that are universally recognizable.
o	Animations & Feedback: Subtle animations for transitions and interactions (e.g., marking tasks complete, updating balances) coupled with gentle haptic feedback for key actions.
o	Empty States: Visually appealing and helpful empty states for sections with no data, guiding users on how to get started.
•	Tab-Specific Design Considerations (Inspired by ToDo One):
o	Home Tab: A vertically scrolling view with distinct sections. Content includes a personalized greeting, a short list of today's tasks (checkbox, title, optional list name), a minimalist "Current Balance" display, and a list of today's habits with checkmarks and subtle streak counts. A clean "+" Floating Action Button (FAB) allows adding tasks, expenses, income, or habits.
o	Tasks Tab: A clean list view with segments like "Today," "Upcoming," or filterable by user-created lists. Task items feature a circular checkbox, task title (strikethrough when completed), and subtle secondary info. Tapping a task opens a minimal detail view, and simple swipe gestures (e.g., right to complete, left to schedule/delete) are supported.
o	Money Tab: A top section clearly displays the current balance, potentially with segmented controls for viewing periods (Week, Month, Year). The main section is a chronological list of transactions, each row showing an icon, category/description, amount (green for income, default for expense), and date. Adding transactions is facilitated by a "+" button leading to a simple modal for input.
o	Habits Tab: Displays a list of defined habits, including habit name, scheduled days, and current streak count. A large, easy-to-tap area allows marking today's completion, with clear visual feedback. Tapping a habit can open a detail view with a minimalist calendar highlighting completed days.
Potential Additional Enhancements & Future Considerations:
•	Customizable Dashboard Widgets: Allow users to personalize their Home Tab with small, at-a-glance widgets from any section.
•	Data Export: Enable users to export their data (CSV, JSON) for external analysis.
•	Advanced Task Management: Implement subtasks, tags/labels for flexible organization, and optional integration with external calendar apps.
•	Advanced Money Management: Include bill reminders and functionality to set and track savings goals.
•	Note Functionality: Add basic formatting (bold, italics, bullet points), note categories/tags, and search functionality.
•	Settings Customization: Allow users to choose their preferred accent color.
